# Rendimiento cores Retroarch en PS Vita
*en inglés y alguno puede variar en futuros updates*

# Consolas
- Atari 2600 (Stella): Fullspeed.
- Atari 7800 (ProSystem): Fullspeed.
- Genesis/Mega Drive/Master System/Game Gear/CD (Genesis Plus GX): Fullspeed, consistent in both cartridge and Sega CD games. Sega 8-bits platforms run fine as well.
- Genesis/Mega Drive/CD/32x (PicoDrive): Fullspeed, consistent in both cartridge and Sega CD games; less overhead than Genesis Plus GX. However, 32X games may run poorly (~40fps).
- NES (FCEUmm): Fullspeed, consistent (This IS the NES, after all... (^^;; )
- NES (Nestopia): Fullspeed, consistent (This IS the NES, after all... (^^;; )
- Neo-Geo CD (NeoCD): Fullspeed in system menus, but inconsistent framerates in-game; expect ~50fps.
- PC Engine (MednaFen): Fullspeed, consistent in HuCard and Super CD-ROM2 games.
- PlayStation (PCSX Re-ARMed): HEAVILY dependent on game, expect anywhere from 60fps in 2D-based games to 30fps in some 3D-based titles.
- SNES (Snes9x 2005): ~55fps - 60fps on standard games, ~50fps on SuperFX-powered games.
- SNES (Snes9x 2005+): ~50fps - 60fps on standard games. Frame drops compared to Regular '05 Snes9x are noticeable, however, on select games.
- SNES (Snes9x 2010): ~40fps on standard games; recommend using Snes9x 2005 instead.
- Sega Saturn (Yabause): Basically nonfunctional, Proof-of-Concept only.
- Vectrex: ~50fps, however this is fullspeed for Vectrex.

# Micro Ordenadores
- MS-DOS (DOSBox): Functional, fairly slow, however; mapping instructions here.
- ZX81 (81): ?
- PC-9801 (NP2K): Functional, but fairly slow.
- ZX Spectrum (Fuse): Full speed.

# Portátiles
- Atari Lynx (Handy): ~60fps
- Game Boy (Gambatte/TGBDual): ~60fps
- Game Boy Advance (gpSP): Generally fullspeed... when it works. Many games won't boot (Monkey Ball Jr., Payback), exhibit compatibility issues (Dragon Ball Z games, Golden Sun 2), or will display inaccuracies (Golden Sun games)
- Game Boy Advance (VBA Next): ~40-50fps. 2D games will perform better, but anything more demanding (Golden Sun, 3D games) will be slow.
- Neo-Geo Pocket (Color) (MednaFen): Fullspeed
- Virtual Boy (MednaFen): ~25fps-30fps
- WonderSwan (Mednafen): Fullspeed on WonderSwan and Color games alike

# Arcades
- Final Burn Alpha: Varies by ROMset, generally better performance than MAME however.
- Capcom CPS1 (Final Burn Alpha): 60fps, consistent.
- Capcom CPS2 (Final Burn Alpha): 60fps, consistent.
- Neo-Geo (Final Burn Alpha): 60fps, consistent.
- FB Neo: Varies by ROMset, generally same performance when playing CPS1/2/NG, but others will be slow.
- MAME 2000 (0.37b5): Varies by ROMset, generally full speed in most cases; may exhibit different performance from FBA.
- MAME 2003 (0.78): Varies by ROMset, generally half-speed, if not slower; recommend using Final Burn Alpha or MAME 2000 (0.37b5) instead.

# Ports
- 2048: Working.
- Cave Story (NXEngine): Fullspeed.
- DOOM (PrBoom): Fullspeed. However, using "Linear" filtering on anything but fog will drop framerates to half-speed.
- Quake (TyrQuake): 40fps-50fps with defaults, adjustable in settings.
